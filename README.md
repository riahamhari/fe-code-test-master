# Times Media – Onboarding Journey (Code Test)

This project implements a simple three-step onboarding journey using **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

The flow allows users to:

1. Select topics they are interested in
2. Select newsletters to subscribe to
3. Review a summary of their selections

All state is managed locally in the browser, with no backend or persistence layer.

## Tech used

- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no framework, no bundler)
- **HTML & CSS** for layout and styling
- **Local in-memory state**
- Data loaded via `fetch()` from static JSON files, with a graceful fallback if loading fails
